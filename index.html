       <img src= https://search.pstatic.net/sunny/?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.freepik.com%2Fpremium-vector%2Fhanging-flag-korea-republic-korea_3482-875.jpg&type=sc960_832>
        <p>I was born in Busan, South Korea, in 2005. I attended school in Korea until the second semester of third grade in elementary school when my family immigrated to Japan. Moving to Japan brought many challenges, the most significant being the language barrier. However, I knew that if I did not overcome this challenge, I would not be able to face future hardships. So, I studied diligently and completed my elementary, middle, and high school education in Japan. Eventually, I was admitted to the College of Information Science and Engineering at Ritsumeikan University.

The reason I applied to the Department of Computer and Information Science is that my interest in this field began in my first year of high school. My math teacher talked about promising future careers, such as developers, and the field of computer engineering related to programming. Since I was young, I have always been curious about how computers are made and how they work. This field seemed like a perfect fit for me.</p>
